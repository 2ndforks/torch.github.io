<!---# Recurrent Model of Visual Attention-->

In this blog post, I want to discuss how we at Element Inc were able to
implemented the recurrent attention model (RAM) described in [[1]](#rmva.ref). 
Not only were we able to reproduce the paper, but we also made of bunch of
useful and usable code available in the process.

We decided that this paper was worth reproducing. 
Let's face it, many of the research papers are difficult or impossible to reproduce
even with help from the original authors [[2]]. 
The authors of [[1]] did a great job on making their paper clear, concise and relatively easy to reproduce.
All but two hyper-parameters are detailed, which means that hyper-parameter search would be relatively easy.
As for those two, the specifies that they were found through random-search.

The paper describes a RAM that can be applied to image classification datasets.
The model is designed in such a way that it has a bandwidth limited sensor of the input image.
So if the input image is of size `28x28` (height x width), the RAM may only be able to 
sense an area of size `8x8` at any given time. These small senses areas are refered to as *glimpses*. 

## SpatialGlimpse ##

Actually, the paper's glimpse sensor is little bit more 
complicated than what we described above, but nevertheless simple. 
Keeping in step with the modular spirit of [Torch7]'s [nn] package, we created a 
[SpatialGlimpse](https://github.com/nicholas-leonard/dpnn#nn.SpatialGlimpse) module.

```lua
module = nn.SpatialGlimpse(size, depth, scale)
```


Basically, if you give it input image is this:

![lenna](images/lenna.png)

And you run this code on it:

```lua
require 'dpnn'
require 'image'

img = image.lena()
loc = torch.Tensor{0,0} -- 0.0 is the center of the image

sg = nn.SpatialGlimpse(128, 3, 2)

output = sg:forward{img, loc}
print(output:size()) --   9 x 128 x 128


-- unroll the glimpse onto its different depths
outputs = torch.chunk(output, 3)
display = image.toDisplayTensor(outputs)
image.save("glimpse-output.png", display)
```

You will end up with the following (unrolled) glimpse :

![glimpse](images/glimpse-output.png)

Although not necessary for reproducing this paper, 
the SpatialGlimpse can also partially be backpropagated through.
While the gradient w.r.t. the `img` tensor can be obtained, 
the gradients w.r.t. the `location` (i.e. the `x,y` coordinates of the glimpse)
will be zero. 
This is because the glimpse operation cannot be differentiated w.r.t. the `location`.
Which brings us to the main difficulty of attention models : 
how can we teach the network to glimpse at the right `locations`?

## Attention ##

The RAM is recurrent in that it can recursively sense multiple locations 
in the image before the classifying the image.
So one of the problems involves teaching the RAM to select the right sequence of glimpses.
