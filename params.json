{"name":"Torch7","tagline":"A numeric computing framework for LuaJIT.","body":"About Torch7\r\n============\r\n\r\nTorch7 is a numeric framework with wide support for machine learning\r\nalgorithm. It is easy to use and provides a very efficient\r\nimplementation, thanks to an easy and fast scripting language, LuaJIT\r\nand an underlying C implementation.\r\n\r\nIf you have questions or need support, check out the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/torch7).\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to install Torch is to follow \r\n[these instructions](https://github.com/torch/ezinstall). This simple script\r\nwill install LuaJIT, Luarocks and build Torch as well as a few important\r\npackages for you.\r\n\r\nTorch, and all its related packages, are now distributed as simple Luarocks packages. \r\nIt only requires LuaJIT (>= 2.0) and Luarocks (>= 2.0.12):\r\n\r\n    $ luajit --version\r\n    uarocks 2.0.12\r\n    $ luajit -v\r\n    LuaJIT 2.0.2 -- Copyright (C) 2005-2013 Mike Pall. http://luajit.org/\r\n    $ luarocks install torch\r\n    ...\r\n\r\nOther packages can be installed the same way, using Luarocks:\r\n\r\n    $ luarocks install image\r\n    $ luarocks list\r\n    $ luarocks search --all\r\n\r\nPackages\r\n--------\r\n\r\nTorch used to be distributed as a single repo, which provided a few default packages.\r\nThese packages, along with their documentation, are now each hosted on their own\r\nGithub repository. Here is the list of official Torch packages:\r\n\r\n* [Torch7](https://github.com/torch/torch7) - [documentation](https://github.com/torch/torch7/blob/master/doc/README.md)\r\n* [nn](https://github.com/torch/nn) - [documentation](https://github.com/torch/nn/blob/master/doc/README.md)\r\n* [paths](https://github.com/torch/paths) - [documentation](https://github.com/torch/paths/blob/master/README.md)\r\n* ...\r\n\r\nMore packages can be found on [Torch's Github portal](https://github.com/torch/).\r\n\r\nEven more packages can be found using Luarocks:\r\n\r\n    $ luarocks search --all\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n-------\r\n\r\nTorch7 is developed at Idiap Research Institute, New York University \r\nand NEC Laboratories America.\r\n\r\nAt this time, Torch7 is maintained by Ronan Collobert (the dictator), \r\nClement Farabet (the chemist) and Koray Kavukcuoglu (Dr Jekyll). \r\n\r\nWe also use the great Qt Lua interface from Leon Bottou.\r\n\r\nIf you use Torch7 for your work, please cite the following paper:\r\nR. Collobert, K. Kavukcuoglu and C. Farabet. Torch7: A Matlab-like \r\nEnvironment for Machine Learning. In BigLearn, NIPS Workshop, 2011.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nTorch7 is distributed under a BSD license. It runs on Linux, FreeBSD \r\nand MacOS X. With few tweaks, it should also run on Windows (we plan to \r\nsupport it soon).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
