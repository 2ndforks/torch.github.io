Applied Deep Learning for Computer Vision with Torch

###Schedule

- A candid introduction to Torch. The philosophy and simplistic design.
- Neural Networks Package: a gentle introduction.
- Optimization Package: an introduction
- Detection using existing pre-trained models (such as googlenet). Fine-tuning on new problems.
- The future of Torch: An Open Discussion

###Audience
Beginner:
The audience requires no knowledge of torch, or deep learning.

Everyone will be given access to a GPU-powered itorch notebook (running via the web browser on Amazon EC2) with Do-it-yourself tutorials.
There will be a walkthrough of the code and tutorials, which can be done at your own pace.

Advanced:
If you are familiar with Torch, join us for an open discussion on the current and future developments of Torch.
