** Slides and Notebooks ** 
- Slides are here: https://github.com/soumith/cvpr2015/blob/master/cvpr-torch.pdf
- ITorch Notebooks are here: https://github.com/soumith/cvpr2015


- **Date and Time: Sunday 7th June, 2015. 0830-1230 (Half Day â€” Morning)**
- **Location:** Room 200

##Schedule

- A candid introduction to Torch. The philosophy and simplistic design.
- Neural Networks Package: a gentle introduction. Hands-on-tutorial using itorch notebooks.
- Optimization Package: an introduction
- Detection using existing pre-trained models (such as googlenet). Fine-tuning on new problems.
- The future of Torch: An Open Discussion

##Audience
####Beginner:
The audience requires no knowledge of torch, or deep learning.

**Everyone will be given access to a GPU-powered itorch notebook** (running via the web browser on Amazon EC2) with Do-it-yourself tutorials.
There will be a walkthrough of the code and tutorials, which can be done at your own pace.

####Advanced:
If you are familiar with Torch, join us for an open discussion on the current and future developments of Torch.
