# Need help?

**Torch** is largely community-maintained, but we are very friendly and helpful.

## Google Groups

Many developers and users answer your questions on the **[mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/embed/?place=forum%2Ftorch7#!forum/torch7)**

## GitHub issues

The **[GitHub issues](https://github.com/torch/torch7/issues)** page is a good place to find answers, and report issues for the core Torch package.
Each package has it's own issue tracker, for example: **[nn issues](https://github.com/torch/nn/issues)**, **[optim issues](https://github.com/torch/optim/issues)**
